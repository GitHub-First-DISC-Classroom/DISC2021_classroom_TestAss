This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Generate time series
n  <- 100   # length of time series
m  <- 0     # series mean
sd <- 1     # series standard deviation

# Code below from Bookdown/Napier 
# Gaussian
Norm_white_noise <- rnorm(n)
mean_line <- rep(m,n)
# Exponential 
Exp_white_noise <- rexp(n)
# Random walk
Norm_ran_walk <- rep(0,n) # Gaussian
Exp_ran_walk <- rep(0,n)

for (i in 2:n) {
  Norm_ran_walk[i] <- Norm_ran_walk[(i-1)] + rnorm(1)
  Exp_ran_walk[i] <- Exp_ran_walk[(i-1)] + rexp(1)
}

# moving average
Norm_mov_avg <- filter(Norm_white_noise,sides=2,rep(1/3,3))  #TAS+Apps: 13

plot(Norm_white_noise, type="o")
lines(mean_line)

plot(Norm_mov_avg, type="o")
lines(mean_line)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
